    "**Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)**\n",
    "- We have access to a lot more computational power. \n",
    "- Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition. \n",

    "- Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly. \n",
    "- Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea. \n",
    "- Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware). \n",

    "**Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)**\n",
    "- It can be trained as a supervised learning problem. \n",
    "- It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words). \n",
